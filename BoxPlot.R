# Group 1 has a median text messages decrease from Baseline to Six months, the
# spread (IQR) seems slightly narrower at Six months. Group 1 also has several 
# outliers below the lower whisker at six months, indicating a few participants 
# sent far fewer messages than the rest. Group 2 has a median text messages 
# remain roughly stable from Baseline to Six months. The spread is similar at 
# both points in time. There is also only a couple of mild outliers at Six months.
# At Baseline, both groups have similar medians. At Six months, Group 1 shows a 
# decrease in median messages, while Group 2 stays consistent.
# Group 1 shows more variability at Six months due to several low outliers, group 
# 2 maintains relatively consistent distribution across time.
# Group 1 may have experienced a reduction in text activity over six months, 
# while Group 2â€™s behavior remained stable.
